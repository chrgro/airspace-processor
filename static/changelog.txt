* Information
* ==========================================================================
* This package contains air space files covering Southern Norway in OpenAir
* format suitable for gliding and gliding software  such as WinPilot and
* SeeYou. 
* 
* The information in these files are based on the excellent work of 
* Hans Cato Grytnes  Nils Barkald  Ole Bårdtvedt  Lars Rune Bjørnevik 
* Arne Martin Güettler, Per Morten Løvsland and Agnar Renolen.
* This information collected from in AIP / ENR. Any errors or requests for

* CONVENTIONS
* ==========================================================================
* 
* - Lower elevations are given in feet as 'ft'
* - Upper elevation are given as flight levels 'FL'
* - The surface elevation is given as 'GND'
* - Traffic Information Zones (TIZ) and Trafic Information Aereas (TIA) are
*   defined as restricted areas (R) though they are formally class G
*   airspace.
* 
* ==========================================================================
* AIRSPORT SECTORS
* ==========================================================================
* 
* Within Oslo  Farris and Flesland TMA as well as Polaris CTA so called 'Airsport sectors' have
* been defined.  These are areas that can be opened and used by glider
* pilots. The sectors are subject to special procedures regarding opening 
* closing and use.  The following documents apply (Norwegian only):
* 
*  http://www.nlf.no/sites/default/files/seilfly/dokument/avtale_luftsportsomrader_oslo_og_farris_tma_10.12.14.pdf
*  http://www.nlf.no/sites/default/files/seilfly/dokument/luftsportsomrader_2011_telefon_og_frekvenser.pdf
*  http://www.nlf.no/sites/default/files/seilfly/dokument/veileder_2011_bakkestasjoner.pdf
*  
* Foreign pilots are adviced to contact local clubs or staff at
* Starmoen airfield for more information.
* 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
* WARNING
* 
* When not open these sectors are controlled airspace, and you need clearance to
* enter!  The frequencies for these sectors listed in the airspace file is the
* frequency of the responsible ATC unit.
* 
* ATCC may change the altitude granted in open airsport sectors at any
* time. The altitude listed in this airspace is the standard altitude,
* but ATCC may give you a different altitude.
* Beware of this when requesting air sport sectors
